Timtams are now part of a loving family of parents +3kids+a maid and loving the wonderful corner house with grass in the compound! ----- TimTams (one is Tim, one is Tam)- to make it easier to call them! Potential adopters should be able to commit to: 1) walking the dogs 2x a day (or keep them in secured bungalow/semi-d/corner house with vast area to roam, as they love running and playing) 2) spend time playing with them (they're still quite young, and will whine for attention unless given regular affection-time with keeper) 3) give fresh water daily & proper food (they eat kibbles) 4) keep shoes in proper shoe cabinet cos one of them is still displaying puppy behaviour of chewing shoes or moving them around (unless he gets adequate exercise and attention) They appear to be brothers, and was roaming Ara Damansara area when found. Plus points about these dogs: 1) trainable: know how to sit/shakehand/come 2) loves children and will play with kids - excellent FAMILY PETs! 3) chase cats (but don't attack them) 4) will bark at strangers - good alert dogs! 5) friendly to keeper and friends 6) great with older folks because of gentle nature - makes excellent FAMIlY PETs! 7) get along with other dogs, even male dogs (possibly because not fully sexually mature and also very gentle + playful in nature), so can join family with existing dogs. NOTE: Will only entertain genuine adopters who'd take either one or both dogs as family pets. They get along well with other dogs. Tim once ran up to an Alsation in my neighbourhood and I thought he'd be minced meat, but they got along fine!
